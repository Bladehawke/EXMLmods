# Bladehawke's EXML mods

**About**
With the *Worlds Part II* update, ***No Man's Sky*** introduced a new modding method for us that means that many of the smaller QOL mods won't have to be recompiled for every patch *and* that they'll only conflict with other mods that change the exact same values.

This is a collection of some of those mods that I made.  Permission is given to use any of them.  Permission to upload them elsewhere is denied without my express permission.
